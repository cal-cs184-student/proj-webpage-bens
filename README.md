# CS184 Project Website

https://cs184.bencuan.me

Created by Ben Cuan and Ben Lin, Spring 2023

## Introduction

This repository contains the writeups for all CS184 projects. The URL for a particular project's writeup is `https://cs184.bencuan.me/posts/projN`, where `N` is the project number.

## Installation
1. Install Hugo.
2. Update PaperMod: `git submodule update --init --recursive`
3. Run: `hugo serve` or `hugo build`

## File Structure

All writeup source is in Markdown and can be found in the `content/posts` directory. 

Images and other static content can be found in the `static/` folder, and are directly accessible from the root of the website. For example, `static/proj1/blacklotus.png` can be accessed at `cs184.bencuan.me/proj1/blacklotus.png`.

## Credits

We used the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) Hugo theme to create this website. 

Some content may be referenced from lecture or other course content; we will cite all instances where direct quotes or images from lecture are used.
